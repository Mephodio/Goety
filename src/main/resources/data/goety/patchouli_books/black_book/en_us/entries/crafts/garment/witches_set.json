Shift-right click it again to turn off Automation."

You can also barter with Witches and Warlocks by right-clicking on them with an Emerald, but only if they're not aggressive or holding something. Unlike the brutish Piglins, the two won't pick up Emeralds thrown at them, you gotta give it to them straight."
