The amount of Soul Energy needed to craft one ingot is very substantial, but you've managed to make one regardless. The metal seems to hunger for it when chipped or damaged and appears to be as tough a material as Diamonds and almost as enchantable as Gold. It also appears to slow down any creature it was struck at."
